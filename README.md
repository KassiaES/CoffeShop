## JUnit 5

The 5th major version of the programmer-friendly testing framework for Java and the JVM
Unit 5 is the next generation of JUnit. The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM. This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.

## Mockito

Mockito is an open source testing framework for Java released under the MIT License. The framework allows the creation of test double objects (mock objects) in automated unit tests for the purpose of test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD).

The framework's name and logo are a play on mojitos, a type of drink.

Features
Mockito allows developers to verify the behavior of the system under test (SUT) without establishing expectations beforehand. One of the criticisms of mock objects is that there is a tight coupling of the test code to the system under test. Mockito attempts to eliminate the expect-run-verify pattern by removing the specification of expectations. Mockito also provides some annotations for reducing boilerplate code.

## JaCoCo - Java Code Coverage Library

Java code coverage tools are of two types: first, tools that add statements to the Java source code and require its recompilation. Second, tools that instrument the bytecode, either before or during execution. The goal is to find out which parts of the code are tested by registering the lines of code executed when running a test.
